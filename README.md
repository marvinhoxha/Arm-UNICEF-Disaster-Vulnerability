# Arm-UNICEF-Disaster-Vulnerability
Identifying thatch-roofed houses for disaster planning in rural Malawi using aerial images

## Description

* Over 80% of Malawi's population resides in rural areas.
* Natural disasters and global challenges like Covid-19 affect these communities.
* Current damage assessment methods overlook crucial data, such as identifying houses with grass-thatched roofs.
* This competition leverages machine learning on aerial imagery to accurately count these structures.
